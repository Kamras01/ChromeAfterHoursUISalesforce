Privacy Policy – AfterHours UI for Salesforce

AfterHours UI for Salesforce does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

All settings, preferences, and theme configurations are stored locally in the user’s browser using Chrome’s storage APIs and are used solely to provide the extension’s functionality.

The extension does not use analytics, tracking technologies, advertising services, or remote code execution.

No data is sold, transferred, or shared with third parties.

The extension operates only on Salesforce domains explicitly specified by the user and does not access content on other websites.
